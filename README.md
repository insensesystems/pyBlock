# pyBlock
Scale is the big issue, with root blockchains like Ethereum only able to process a mere 15-20 transactions per second. PyBlock is a Proof of Concept Application for the ‘Layer 2 Solution’. Layer 2 allows you to massively cut down data processing on the blockchain by running computations off-chain. The base chain will still be the ultimate judge when there are disputes. The main benefit of second layer is that it minimizes the amount of data storage on the base layer. Taking transactions off the base layer, while still anchored to it, would free up processing resources to do other things while still getting the security and decentralization benefits.
